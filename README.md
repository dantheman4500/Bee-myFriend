## Introduction: 

For our final project, we challenged ourselves to create a social media application. In the world of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram ads, we believe social media has strayed away from it's core power and purpose: connection. Bee My Friend seeks to scale back the modern social media platform and bring it back to what it's all about, finding your community, seeking companionship, and connecting on shared interests.  

## Project Description:

<ul>
Bee My Friend is a clean, modern social media application that allows users to create their own profile, find people based on shared interests, and create a digital community for themselves. 



- This project uses the MERN stack to provide a responsive and visually appealing user experience.

- The application relies on databases such as MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. 

- Our project uses queuries and mutations to support user interaction with features such as "Search by Interest" or updating their profile. 

- For a polished UI, Bee My Friend leans on Chakra UI for clean looking elements such as a dark/light toggle button, collapsible navigation side bar, etc. 

- As an added bonus, Malek created a donation function with Stripe to allow outside users to donate to developers.
</ul>


## User Story:

As a user, I want a social media app that allows me to find users based on similar interests.

## Coding Requirements: 

```md
Use React for the front end.

Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
```
## Before You Start

Prior to starting your application please make sure you have all the proper dependecies installed.

If you have cloned the repository, please run the following command in your terminal:

`npm install`

IMPORTANT! For the app to run locally: in the server folder, replace the asterisk `*` with a forward slash `/` in the server.js file on line 26. (Example: `app.get('/'`)

Then seed the database by running `npm run seed`. Start the app by running `npm run develop`.


## Technologies, Libraries, UI Used:

MERN Stack which consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js

Chakra UI for front end and user interface. 

Stripe for donation features.
